# EssentialsofDeepLearning
In this project, we learn and play essential mathematical components of deep learning on a simple artificial neural network by using the MATLAB script provided by C. F. Higham and D. J. Higham along with their paper ''Deep Learning: An Introduction for Applied Mathematicians''. Minor changes have been made to the original script.
