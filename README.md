# EssentialsofDeepLearning
In this project, we learn and play essential mathematical components of deep learning on a simple artificial neural network by using the MATLAB script provided by C. F. Higham and D. J. Higham along with their paper ''Deep Learning: An Introduction for Applied Mathematicians''. Minor changes have been made to the original script.
This projects was done as part of the masters course "Linear Algebra and Learning from Data" at Stockholm University in 2020.

This file includes:
- a summary of the project
- the (Matlab) code for the activation function
- the main (Matlab) code setting up the training data, intializing weights and biases, backpropagation and classification of the data points
- resuls of the classifications as pictures
